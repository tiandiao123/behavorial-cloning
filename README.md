In this project, I will train data sets of photos taken from cameras of the simulation cars using neural network model, and then output the steer angle of the cars! Then, save my model data into a file, and test my model in my simulation car software to see whether my neural network have good performance

you can download your software for training data in this website:https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/(Linux)November/5831f0f7_simulator-linux/simulator-linux.zip, and make sure the IMG folder is in the same directory as self_driving_car_simulation directory.

My method: Use Alexnet as my begining point, and extend Alecnet to a deeper neural network so that I can get a better result! Also, I referenced some codes from the original codes of Alexnet and the training parameters of Alexnet neural network! 

This project is from udacity!
